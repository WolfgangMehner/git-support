README for git-support.vim (Version 0.9.4) / April 23 2019
================================================================================

  *  INSTALLATION
  *  RELEASE NOTES
  *  FILES
  *  CREDITS


Integration of Git for Vim/gVim. The plug-in at hand allows to use Git from
within Vim, eliminating the need for context switches. The output of commands
like "git status" is written into buffers, and the commit can be manipulated
from right there. Further commands allow to quickly add the file in the
current buffer or show its diff.
Please read the documentation.

This plug-in can be used with Vim version 7.3+ and Neovim 0.2.1+.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION
================================================================================

(1) LINUX
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `git-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory

      $HOME/.vim/

(find the value of `$HOME` with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(1.1) Copy the zip archive `git-support.zip` to `$HOME/.vim` and run

      unzip git-support.zip

(1.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the file in `$HOME/.vim/git-support/rc` as a starting point.

(1.3) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc/

(1.4) To get a syntax highlighting closer to the one Git uses, take a look at
   the suggestions in `git-support/rc/additions.vimrc`, which offers example
   settings for bright and dark backgrounds.

(1.5) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or
   extensions for your `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of
   them. The files are documented.

(2) WINDOWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `git-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory

      $HOME/vimfiles/

(find the value of `$HOME` with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(2.1) Copy the zip archive `git-support.zip` to `$HOME/vimfiles` and run

      unzip git-support.zip

(2.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the file in `$HOME/vimfiles/git-support/rc` as a starting point.

(2.3) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME\vimfiles\doc\

(2.4) Set the correct executable. This is not necessary if `git` is already on
   your path. See `:help g:Git_Executable`.

(2.5) To get a syntax highlighting closer to the one Git uses, take a look at
   the suggestions in `git-support\rc\additions.vimrc`, which offers example
   settings for bright and dark backgrounds.

(2.6) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or
   extensions for your `_vimrc` and `_gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of
   them. The files are documented.


(3) ADDITIONAL REMARKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  the Git executable
  *  removing the Git menu
  *  the syntax highlighting
  *  the behavior of various commands

Please read the documentation:

      :help gitsupport

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNOWN ISSUES
================================================================================

* Windows: When entered on the Vim command line, commands containing filenames
  as parameters cause errors such as "... file not found ...".
  - This may happen if filenames contain special characters such as spaces. The
    Vim command line escapes those differently then Windows expects then to be
    escaped.
  - However, a filename containing spaces can always be escape using quotes:
      :GitAdd "help 1.txt"
  - If you already are in the corresponding buffer, simply use:
      :GitAdd
